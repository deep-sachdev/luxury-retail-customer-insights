3,14/03/2025,I bought a skims top and it wouldn't let me use apple pay? who doesn't allow apple pay in 2025Seriously unlikely to buy again- massive hassle when i've not had to reach for my card in what feels like years.

8,13/03/2025,"I have said it before and I will say it again - Harrods is my absolute 'must go to' Store when I am in London!  There is something for everyone with every budget.  I recently went for some retail therapy on my birthday and, once again, yes I was exhausted at the end of the day - but not disappointed!  I noticed, too, that there were a lot of young, enthusiastic and courteous Assistants of different nationalities, which made my shopping experience all the more pleasurable.  Thank you - I'll be back!"
9,16/03/2025,"I just had the best experience at Estée Lauder, all thanks to Kim! My friend and I were shopping for some new products, and she went above and beyond to help us. She’s incredibly knowledgeable—she knew exactly what would work for our skin and gave us the best recommendations. On top of that, she’s so sweet and patient, making the whole experience even more enjoyable. If you’re shopping at Estée Lauder, I highly recommend asking for Kim—she’s amazing!"

13,16/03/2025,"We were served by Michelle at Porada. She is knowledgeable about the product, friendly and efficient. The entire interaction was a pleasure and cannot be faulted."
14,16/03/2025,It was great I served very quick the staff it was polite and very helpful
15,13/03/2025,I was looking at the Hourglass blushes and had no idea which to choose.  Marta offered to help me. She picked the perfect shade. I was very happy with the service. She was very polite and helpful.
16,14/03/2025,"I visited Hermes on Friday with my husband  and had the absolute pleasure of being assisted by Fabiola again  to purchase my very first Birkin bag.  I was so excited as I had waited about 9months for my wish to come. From the moment I walked in, she made me feel so welcome and comfortable. Fabiola was not only incredibly knowledgeable about the brand but also genuinely kind and patient. She took her time to understand exactly what I was looking for. It’s rare to come across someone who combines professionalism with such warmth and sincerity. Thank you also to Thom her manger who we got to meet also  both of them truly went above and beyond to make our visit such a lovely one—Diolch yn fawr"
17,13/03/2025,I felt welcomed and my need was met swiftly
18,15/03/2025,"We regularly buy cakes and pastries in Harrods any we are often served by Sara. Sara is always friendly , professional and helpful; and she always has a warm smile when she serves us . Thank you for your service Sara ."
19,14/03/2025,"The lady who helped me was passionate about the make up brand that I was enquiring about, she also fully supported me to choose the right shade and also give me some great advice as to how to get the best of the product and also what are the products to pair it with which I then also decided to buy as I could see how amazing they were, when she put them on my skin. She gave amazing advice and also nothing was a trouble. She also advised me that I could get some free samples because of how much I spend in store which again was really lovely of her as I knew nothing about the scheme. The next time I come back I will definitely try and find that lady again as she was really incredible.Very very happy and it was my first time in my 42 years being shade matched and supported to find products which were really great and I could instantly tell the difference."
20,06/03/2025,"The level of service I received from both the duty manager at the hair salon and the customer service team reflects the disregard Harrods today has for its clients.I have been going to the same hairstylist for over 10 years, but on this occasion, he was unavailable, so I was seen by someone else. I encountered an issue with this hairstylist, who was deliberately vague about the cost of a service. When I inquired about the price of trimming 3cm off my hair—on top of several other services, including a blow dry—his response was simply, “It’s the price of a haircut.” At the till, I was shocked to learn that this so-called “haircut” cost £115, in addition to the £80 blow dry. Had I been given an accurate price upfront, I would have declined the service, especially since I hadn’t initially booked it and was only asked on the spot if I wanted a trim.While the price itself is excessive for what was done, my main issue lies in the way I was treated. Both the salon staff and customer service were rude, condescending, and dismissive, defending the lack of clear pricing as acceptable. According to consumer rights, this was neither transparent nor fair—it was outright misleading.Rather than acknowledging the mistake, I was forced to argue my case for over an hour across multiple floors, in full view of other customers. The lack of discretion and basic courtesy only added to the humiliation.It’s disappointing to see that Harrods would rather lose a loyal client—who spends tens of thousands of pounds a year in-store and has trusted the same hairstylist for over a decade—over something that could have been resolved with a simple admission of fault.For reference, my Rewards number is 7042776316506435, should customer service wish to verify this experience."
21,13/03/2025,"Great service, very relaxed. My pedicure was amazing and my toes look beautiful! Thank you !"
22,13/03/2025,"I had an amazing shopping experience thanks to Connor from Tom Ford and Enrico from Dior—both went above and beyond to help me find exactly what I needed!Enrico was incredibly kind and patient, assisting me in trying on different shoes until I found the perfect fit. His friendly and attentive approach made the entire interaction so enjoyable.Connor was equally helpful in trying to track down a perfume sample I had received a few months ago. Although we couldn't find the exact one, he took the time to guide me through other scents until I discovered the perfect alternative. He also informed me about a £80 makeup deal that's redeemable, which really enhanced my experience and encouraged me to return in the future.Although I didn't make a purchase at Gucci, I stopped by with my partner to have a look, and the experience was wonderful. The sales associate was incredibly lovely she helped me try on a bag that was absolutely perfect! She took the time to explain everything I needed to know about it and was so personable and friendly. Her warm and engaging approach made the visit truly enjoyable. 💕 Their excellent service and genuine care made all the difference—I'll definitely be back!"
23,14/03/2025,The Harrods app is so crap to use !!! Rubbish tech engineers that have designed the app that barely works and keeps kicking you out and doing all sorts of different things. It’s pathetic for such a large company.This has been going on for over a year
24,01/03/2025,Had an issue with Harrods Beauty Rewards whilst at the Milton Keynes store. Started quickly by the manager and even got a call to follow it up. Excellent service
25,13/03/2025,"Good advice, great service ( from Chloe) and a good selection of brands and products in store."
26,13/03/2025,Lucy was  super helpful and knowledgeable sales assistant in Dyson harrods .Very happy 😊
27,05/03/2025,I wanted to purchase something special for my big birthday and when I walked into the shop Ed and the other members of staff provided me with a warm welcome. I then spoke with indicating what I was looking for and he provided me with excellent advice and customer service.
28,09/03/2025,"We were served by Anisoara and she was outstanding! She was warm, welcoming, and very attentive to our needs. Her professionalism and kindness made our experience truly special. Thank you for the wonderful service!”"
29,19/02/2025,"I recently made a purchase of a luxury item valued at £710 from Harrods, expecting a seamless shopping experience befitting their renowned reputation. Unfortunately, the service I received was far from the high standard one would expect from such a prestigious store.I placed my order over the phone, and it arrived via post; however, the condition of the package was incredibly disappointing. The box was ripped open, and the contents inside were damaged. It was clear that the item had not been properly handled or protected during shipping, which is especially concerning given the high value of the purchase.As a customer who trusted Harrods to deliver quality service and luxury items in pristine condition, I am truly let down by this experience. The lack of care in packaging and the obvious damage to the product are unacceptable for a company that prides itself on providing top-tier products and service.I have reached out to customer service on numerous occasions for a resolution, but the process has been frustrating and far from the level of support one would expect when dealing with such a high-end retailer. It's disheartening that a luxury store like Harrods doesn't seem to prioritise customer satisfaction or properly safeguard their products during delivery.I hope this review serves as a cautionary tale for anyone considering ordering from Harrods, especially expensive luxury goods. While their reputation precedes them, this experience has been a stark reminder that even established luxury brands can fall short in delivering a seamless and enjoyable customer experience."
30,10/03/2025,"Great service by this incredible member of staff, Barbara 🌺"
31,10/03/2025,Gabrielle served me today and she was very helpful. I am new to makeup and she was very patient and informative and gave me useful tips. She listened to what I needed and found the right products.
32,10/03/2025,"Went into Harrods today because it was my birthday about 1 o’clock was feeling quite hungry so thought I’d go into the fish restaurant that I was directed to was no queue up which was great. Went to go and sit down but the chairs didn’t move. They were sorted like fixed, which was a bit off putting But started to read the menu then I saw the chef start sneezing into a handkerchief over the food, it totally put me off and ruined my day. I walked out of the restaurant and went to Peter Jones and had food in there. I couldn’t believe that a world famous Establishment have such badly trained chefs if he had a cold He should not be in the restaurant serving food he should be at home resting But sneezing over the food is absolutely disgusting And goes against every health and safety regulation So because of this shocking horrible experience I don’t think I’d ever be going back to Harrods For any of my birthdays With Covid and flu If they’re ill, should not be at work got this onAt Harrods, we take food safety and hygiene incredibly seriously, and we sincerely apologise for any discomfort this experience may have caused. Please rest assured that your feedback has been recorded and maintaining the highest standards of service and cleanliness is our priority.10 working days after I got totally disappointed with Harrods fish restaurant with the service chef or person sneezing over the food No one has contacted me back since the My second email I sent back Still waiting to see what they’re going to do, why is it taking so long? I cannot believe in a restaurant or shop that’s world famous That they would have staff sneezing over the food Doesn’t look like I will ever be going back thanks for ruining my birthday.this show how much you don't care about your customers."
33,10/03/2025,"I’ve left a review previously BUT I feel I need to leave another!!! ONE STAR IS TOO MUCH! I’ve gone past the crying and upset stage now and I’m just angry!! HARRODS ARE THE WORST COMPANY EVER!!!!! The customer service is next to SHITE!!!!! I honestly don’t no who they think they are! ROBBERY is what they do! Harrods are theiving scums! They are quite quick to take thousands of hard earned money off people and refuse to give it back! I have been fighting something for almost 5 months now! They’ve had the item I returned to them 15th October 2024 AND my money since! I’ve asked them to dispatch it back to me….today (a week later) I get an “apology” email for the late reply with the tracking details I’ve chased up twice this past week….to realise the item was finally coming back…but the courier was due in the next 30mins! Is that a joke! So I’ve had to rush home from work!! Just when I honestly thought they couldn’t get any worse…..that was just the icing on the top of the cake!!! Would I use them again, NEVER!!!! Would I recommend them, NEVER! Would I visit a store NEVER!!! I will never give them another penny ever again! And all my family and friends are aware of what’s happened to me, they have seen all the emails and photos  and won’t be using them either! Appalling, dishonest company!!!! I also see the “one star reviews” are staring to take over the better reviews! HARRODS GIVE YOURSELF A WOBBLE AND SORT IT OUT!"
34,01/03/2025,"I went into H beauty with a vague idea of what I wanted and came out happy with what I got because of Shakila. Friendly and helpful, she took her time to understand what I was looking for and recommended some great products. I look forward to visiting again !"
35,08/03/2025,Malek from Bond no9 was fantastic. Extremely perfect and helped my fiancé and I pick out the perfect fragrances.
36,08/03/2025,"I visited Harrods Beauty, in Cribbs, Bristol yesterday evening with my daughter, excited to purchase some sprays and lotions with her pocket money. Unfortunately, our experience was completely overshadowed by the unwelcoming and uncomfortable behavior of a security guard.From the moment we walked in, he followed us closely around the store. Every time we stopped to look at a product, he stopped too. I even smiled awkwardly at him, hoping to ease the tension, but he continued watching us as if we were doing something wrong. Even my daughter noticed, whispering, “Mummy, that man is following us.” It was clear that, for whatever reason, we were being unfairly targeted.As a Black woman shopping with my Black daughter, I couldn’t help but wonder if this was racially motivated. We were simply there to shop, yet we were made to feel like suspects rather than valued customers. This feeling stayed with me even after we paid—I felt it necessary to hold the receipt in my hand, along with our purchase, just in case we were questioned, as if I had to prove we hadn’t stolen anything.This was especially disappointing because the rest of the staff were lovely—friendly, welcoming, and even complimented my daughter’s choice of products. But no amount of kindness from them could erase how uncomfortable and humiliated we felt.No one should feel this way while shopping. I truly hope Harrods Beauty takes this feedback seriously and ensures that all customers, regardless of race or background, are treated with fairness, respect, and dignity."
37,09/03/2025,Rachel helped me with products I’ve needed.

40,05/03/2025,"Alex and Mansi were absolutely amazing and so professional, they had helped me to choose present for my friends 40th birthday and sorted  everything out! Also I was invited to upcoming events and received loads of helpful tips how to look after my skin and what products would be beneficial for my age. Service I have received was absolutely outstanding! Keep the great work going Girls! X"
41,07/03/2025,"Everything and more. So many staff ready to assist you in every department. The food halls are exceptional, every fresh product looked perfect. This all comes at a high price but you are paying for the best"
42,06/03/2025,"Initially I felt a bit overwhelmed with all the, different counters and products, however a friendly member of staff (Jill) offered help.  She listened to what I was after and was very helpful and made me feel at ease. She took her time to listen to what I was looking for and showed me several options. We found the products that were right for me and I left having a very nice shopping experience. (H Beauty, Edinburgh)"

44,04/03/2025,"I was so pleased to come across Unal Keray when  I was looking for a dinning table. He was very professional, and helpful from the very beginning. He made it very easy for me to choose. His advice and explanation were always welcome and he responded very promptly to  any queries…. either by email or telephone. He was forthcoming with helpful suggestions. I am very grateful and thankful to Unal for all his help to help me make up mind about the purchase. Harrods is very lucky to have someone like Unal to serve the public in REFLEX (Furniture Department). Thanks Unal for all your help!"
45,07/03/2025,"I’ve been meaning to write this feedback for a long time but never got the chance. I had the pleasure of working with Harold even before meeting him in person, and he was incredibly helpful from the very start. When I finally met him this month at Harrods, he made sure to fit me into his schedule although it was last minute appointment. He is attentive, knowledgeable, and patient, always going above and beyond to assist. Even on his days off, he takes the time to respond and provide support, which truly shows his dedication. I truly enjoy shopping with him, and since working with Harold, I’ve had the best experience with Harrods. His exceptional service and professionalism makes every purchase smooth and easy."
46,05/03/2025,Fantastic! Good to be back after a while!
47,05/03/2025,"Dear Harrods Customer Service management,I received the trainers today, March 5, 2025, at 13:50 PM, and I am absolutely appalled by what I have received. If this so-called “repair” was done by Dior, then I am even more disappointed. The damages have merely been painted over, which is a completely unacceptable and unprofessional resolution.I expected better service from both Harrods and Dior, yet this experience has been nothing short of disgraceful. This will not be taken lightly. I am now escalating my complaint to the ombudsman and will seek legal advice if necessary.This is my final attempt to allow you to resolve this issue properly. I expect an urgent response, either with a full refund or a proper replacement. Anything less will not be accepted.I await your immediate action on this matter."
48,05/03/2025,"I have received a Superb Make Up Consultation at H Beuty Edinburgh by Marta. Marta is passionate about her job and provided impeccable customer service. She made sure she understood my make up routine and gave me bespoken advice on how to elevate it and the results were astonishing! She introduced me to new products and brands which I wouldn't have ever considered. Marta is so skillful and gives personalised suggestion based on Skin Tone, skin type and style. What I appreciated the most is the assertiveness where she encouraged me to try a make up which is normally not my go to, and I am so glad I let her do as the final result was unbelievable and really enhances my features. The outcome of the consultation exceeded my expectations as Marta is so knowledgeble and has gained my full trust and admiration. I left the shop feeling amazing and looking forward to use the products I bought. H Beauty Edinburgh will defo become my go to place for future purchase. Thank you Marta!"
49,19/02/2025,I do love shopping at Harrods
50,03/03/2025,Unal Keray and the reflex team were exceptional and the quality of service faultless
51,04/03/2025,"We dealt with Mr Unal Keray who assisted us tremendously in choosing our dining table. He was always polite and helpful and went out of his way to ensure that all our requests and wishes were attended to. He responded promptly to any emails and  our calls and guided us through the process. He made it very easy. It was indeed a pleasure to deal with such a pleasant and thoroughly  efficient person especially since we live far away, were therefore unable to attend personally and have to do business remotely. Harrods should be proud to have such employees representing their business ."
52,03/03/2025,Love the Harrods chocolate. The sales lady Atur at the airport T2 provided me a great services. Thank you.
53,28/02/2025,"What an amazing experience. Popped into Harrods for a delayed 40th birthday present. I enquired at Rolex and was met by Tanya. What can I say. The friendliest and informative service ever. I was made to feel at ease, comfortable and at no point was I pressured. I was more than happy to go ahead with the transaction and shall definitely be back to mark further milestones. Thank you again Tanya, best customer service ever!"
54,04/03/2025,"Amika provided world class service by sending pictures of the merchandise and connecting with me via FaceTime to ensure I was getting what I wanted and then continued to shop with me by carrying me through multiple departments! She is a true ambassador and asset to your store and because of her, I will happily continue to shop with Harrod's in the future."
55,04/03/2025,Sev was great throughout the entire process and my hair looks great!
56,08/02/2025,Harley was a great beauty consultant took time to explain products.  Great customer experience made me feel special
57,02/03/2025,I visited the Dior counter. Habibi was so helpful. I ended up having my make up done and made some purchases. She also talked me through how she had achieved the look and gave me some handy eye shadow application tips. She was genuinely friendly and chatty. She also recommended joining the loyalty scheme.
58,02/03/2025,H beauty in Milton Keynes is a great shopping experience- very helpful staff and well stocked brands
59,02/03/2025,Very helpful & friendly sales assistant. Felt very encouraged to deal with the assistant
60,21/01/2025,"I was approached by a personal shopper in the Harrods jewellery section, who took my number and claimed to offer me a faster service for some earrings. Since then, he has been spamming me on WhatsApp with hundreds of pictures, including animal skin handbags, despite me being anti-fur and also reminding the assistant how I strongly oppose. It’s disturbing that Harrods continues to sell such products and how the staff are promoting them. I’ve since had to block this individual due to his forceful, inhumane sales delivery. Shame on you Harrods!"
61,21/02/2025,"The toy that was being demonstrated on the shop floor was very fascinating and catchy. We were really impressed by it and upon enquiring how it works, the employee said with something behind your ear and magnetics. Hearing that it seemed like a good idea and we gave in the demand of our kids and bought the toy.  Upon unboxing at home, we found out there was nothing magnetic in it. Just a cheap thin plastic saucer which you stick with blutac provided and a thin (breakable thread). Definitely not worth the price of £25 and was not impressed with quality.  Still can't believe Harrods would scam customers like that.  😐"
62,01/03/2025,The whole bakery/cake section is awful now. Used to be really good food and decent price wise. Now the cakes taste like something you buy from a shop and forget about for a month
63,01/03/2025,"Danielle was so lovely, warm and inviting, I did not feel pressured at all to buy products ( but I did buy them). Her advice and knowledge was amazing."
64,28/02/2025,The staff are great in their hospitality and support. Staff know how to explain the qualities in there product.

66,01/03/2025,"Connor is absolutely amazing! Every time I visit Harrods Edinburgh Beauty, he provides exceptional service with his extensive knowledge and expertise. He truly understands the products and always helps me make the right choice, ensuring I leave feeling confident in my purchase. His professionalism, patience, and friendly approach make the shopping experience an absolute pleasure. Highly recommend seeking him out—he’s the best!"

70,22/02/2025,The customer service at H beauty lakeside is spot on. I visited the Maison Francis Kurkdjian section with the intention of buying one fragrance and ended up buying two. I was served by a lovely lady Yana who was kind and patient with me. Will be visiting again soon.
71,28/02/2025,I was wary when a personal shopper contacted me about an out of stock item I had enquired about at harrods. I was convinced it was for the higher echelons of society which I’m so not. I was so wrong - Amika and her team of personal shoppers contacted me within an hour of my query telling me she had 4 items. She put them aside for me straight away before even calling. I ordered two and the cost was the cost price- no additional cost just normal postage (£5) in addition Amika was polite friendly confident and very very efficient. Definitely will use her services again - thanks Amika
72,26/02/2025,Great customer service and very knowledgeable on the product.
73,26/02/2025,"During my visit to Hbeauty Lakeside, I was approached in a highly professional manner. The staff demonstrated exceptional professionalism and treated me with great respect, making my experience at the shop very comfortable and enjoyable."
74,11/02/2025,"Unsure! I have been using the Personal Shopping department for a few months now and it has been incredibly convenient as I live outside of London. I have been awaiting for Hermes to fulfil my wish item, and I was told by my Personal Shopper, Kasey. If I was to pay £3000 more he could help me get my wish Birkin. I have not heard of this option before and reached out to the person who put me in contact with Kasey, Jason, however have never received a response. I have no other contact options but have previously seen Harrods reply to these reviews, If my thoughts could be passed on to someone I would deeply appreciate. Thank you. Beth"
75,20/02/2025,My SA Muna told me there is a promotion on RV Unfortunately she was on leave for a week i called the store to see who can help me to check the stock Elisk was the one who helped me when Muna was on leave I checked with Elisk if the promotion was still on She confirmed me is YesBut after a few hours she said her Manager Lionel Cruz has changed the ruleI was so angry that he changed the thresholds without any prior noticeAnd when Lionel called me back to explain it. He was not nice and the reason was totally nonsense and unacceptable

82,12/02/2025,"I ordered a Prada handbag from Harrods online for my wife for Valentine's Day, as a nice gesture after a period of illness. I used Harrods as they had an expedited delivery service, and it was a trusted retailer ( or I thought so). The good news, it arrived on time but that's where the good news ended ; firstly the bag we received was packed into a generic Harrods outer box which was too small so the bag was crushed. Furthermore it was in a dirty outer dust bag, had all the labels already cut off and placed in a zipper compartment, straps undone, and worst of all was scuffed on the bottom. It was clearly not new and best case a display item, but most likely a customer return. Totally unacceptable for a bag costing full price £4150. I was dismayed especially as it was to be a nice surprise for my wife, so I immediately ordered a replacement direct from Prada. This item came 2 days later in a beautifully presented branded box, labels attached, all the metal clasps carefully wrapped with soft tissue, and the bag filled with tissue - as one would expect of a new bag!I sent the original bag back to Harrods for review the same day I received it ( after having to drive 30 mins to the nearest DHL drop off) and waited patiently for a response. My credit card at this point had £8300 on it ! Eventually I got news I would get a refund, but was absolutely 'gobsmacked' to hear that their internal review had shown it was sent out in good condition and had passed their internal checks. What?!So this is what to expect of a luxury retailer like Harrods? I've asked them to review their response with senior management ... all I want is an honest answer about how their team could allow an expensive handbag to be sent to a customer in such a bad state, and that was clearly not new. Or are they really happy for this to be their standard of service?"
83,22/02/2025,I met Ashleigh and she was super helpful. A very patient lady and sure to guide you through the lot until you make an informed decision. Her service ms were exceptional. Highly recommend.Thank you Ashleigh. Keep being you
84,23/02/2025,Chetna was very kind and professionnal.
85,29/10/2024,"Great to have a store like H Beauty in the MetroCentre; shame about the clientele. Also, a lot of the college educated bright orange teens working behind the counter could do with learning some manners, especially when you’re spending their monthly salary on items in store.Harrods in London is again great (barring all the tourists), but staff are so desperate for the sale that they practically jump down your throat. Much better customer service if you go to the individual brands’ flagship store."
86,23/02/2025,Lovely place for a champagne and/or cocktail or two. Staff are always very friendly and professional.
87,22/02/2025,Jemma and Natasha were fantastic! They went over and above to look after us! We had the best morning with them and can’t wait to go back xx
88,23/02/2025,Outstanding services as expected fromHarrods. Assistant was very knowledgeable and helpful in picking the best Scotch. Excellent & world class services.
89,22/02/2025,"I took my mother to get her make up for her Mother’s Day present and our experience was fabulous! Charlee-Lou who served us was so professional, kind and friendly and made my mum feel at ease. She did a colour match on my mum, which my mum had never experienced before and my mum loved it and loved the make up. We both really hope that we get to see Charlee-Lou again when we go back!"
90,22/02/2025,I was looking for a lighter foundation and Maheen listened to me and provided great advice. She took the time to give me different options and gave me tips on how to apply the product. She even gave me lots of samples to try other products.
91,21/02/2025,Was made to feel very welcome at their Rolex boutique. Sales executive Ediz understood my needs and discussed various models/options. Looking forward to my next visit and purchase. Thank you
92,25/01/2025,Horrendous experience in the restaurant where we were treated very differently we believe due to our skin colour . Reported to Harrods in an email rather than a review and technically fobbed of twice no apology so here we go don’t go to Harrods if you want treat with dignity and equality ! Oh by the way we did spend a significant amount too !!
93,01/02/2025,Overpriced restaurants that implement a cover charge and mandatory service charge!!
94,21/02/2025,"Petre is a real professionist, that cares and  makes the customer feel special and appreciated. It was my first time buying from Neuhaus and barely knew something from them . He patiently explained me about each chocolate and flavour and a little bit of their history, he has an exceptional knowledge about the company and products of what he is selling. I’m sure the company is really proud and lucky to have such a great employee in their team . Also the way of speaking and connecting with the customer is to another level I felt so intrigued into the interaction and his way of talking is really professional and his attitude really speaks for itself about his experience. I would definitely recommend coming to the store and enjoy yourself with some chocolate and especially when such great employee like Peter are making your experience much worth it ."
95,09/02/2025,Sales manager Sofia has done amazing work! Perfectly recommended skin care + foundation and powder by Charlotte Tilbury. I am highly satisfied with top notch service and quality of products bought.
96,22/02/2025,I went in looking for a full coverage foundation and was directed over to the Estée Lauder section. Christine was able to find me a brilliant colour match which was actually much lighter than my current foundation. The new foundation was a better and brighter natural match. Because this did not match the makeup I currently had on she offered to remove my makeup and then reapply using the new colour to see how it looked. She completely removed my makeup by using multiple different products then added serums and moisturiser before applying the foundation. Following this she added more makeup to make it a more complete look. I was incredibly happy with the colour and makeup that Christine had done. She was incredibly helpful and knowledgable about the products. She was even kind enough to give some goodies alongside my new foundation. I will definitely be recommending Harrods Beauty and Christine to others.
97,21/02/2025,"Harrods has completely changed, staff on they're phones, ignoring customers, when being served, made to feel like we were at a supermarket check out, a lot of the food does not taste the same even though they are charging more for it now. Extremely disappointing and definitely not worth the drive down from Birmingham unfortunately.  It's not the same, it's just like every other store."
98,22/02/2025,"Really positive experience , served by Annabelle who was knowledgeable and helpful and I was very happy with my shopping experience and purchases"
99,21/02/2025,"I had the most wonderful shopping experience at Chanel Harrods, thanks to the impeccable service provided by Stefano Rouissi. From the moment I arrived, I was warmly welcomed and offered water and champagne, which made the experience feel even more special.Stefano’s knowledge of Chanel’s classic handbags was truly impressive. He took the time to guide me through the details of each piece I was interested in, sharing valuable insights and making me feel confident in my choices. His professionalism, patience, and passion for the brand were evident throughout the entire visit.If you’re looking for exceptional service and expertise, I highly recommend asking for Stefano Rouissi. He truly made my visit unforgettable, and I can’t wait to return!"
100,20/02/2025,Fantastic service and the best department store in the world 👌
101,16/02/2025,Great care from Saman and Stephanie on the 3rd and 4th floors. Delightful shopping experience.
102,19/02/2025,"Terrible food, extremely small portions for extortionate prices. Terrible waiters who were taking their job very non-seriously. It was very difficult to get their attention. I wouldn't ever go there again! Useless horrible miniaturised food, horrible staff, ripped menus!"
103,19/02/2025,"Whenever I pop into Harrods, I always ask if there are any testers. A lot of the time, the products are from brands I haven’t used before and quite often I go onto buy the product, whether it is through Harrods or not. When asking this time around, the employee actively scuffed at me and went on to say, rather rudely, ‘you need to spend more than £60’. Where I can partially understand her reasoning, although this has never been an issue before, the huff prior took me aback. The employee obviously noticed how shocked I was at her attitude and swiftly threw two samples to me. I came away from the store feeling exceedingly embarrassed, almost as if my small, sale purchase made me ‘unworthy’ of the, usually, excellent Harrods customer service."
104,02/02/2025,"I have been a customer of Harrods for over 30 years. Recently I visited Harrods Optician Andrea with whom I used to test my eye, referred me to Anika. Unfortunately she doesn't have clean proceeders as any optician would be.   She does not santize her hands. She did not clean the machines before testing, which resulted in my getting an eye infection.     Further to Anika's dirty den, I met her manager Laura, instead of solving the situation, she was rude. Harrods customer service failed to investigate Anika's method.   Every Harrods customer should be able to trust the Harrods Optician to have safe and professional eye testing.     No Harrods customer should experience Non Hygienic & Dirty protocols.Anika should sanitize her hands before examination and during.  She must clean the machines before every test.  Harrods is oblivious to their Harrods Optician team are fraudulently ripping off Harrods customers by making a  Falsifying eye tests results and Andrea sells new glasses.  Anika changed my Eye test results dramatically so I have to buy a new eye lenses for £1000.00.   This is a Big Scheme at Harrods Optician orchestrated by Laura, Anika and Andrea!  I believe in ethics and most certainly eye testing must be a hygienic and honest.Harrods Optician should be investigated by a UK optician association."
105,16/02/2025,Bought a new fragrance and makeup from Dereck at Dolce and Gabbana. Amazing person and very attentive. Convinced me in seconds and had a nice chat with the lad. 10/10 will be coming back for him.
106,18/02/2025,Hiral was just lovely. I had such a good experience with her that I made a big impulse buy. She really made my day and I’m glad I came by.
107,17/11/2024,"POSH, EXPENSIVE PRICES, SOME QUALITY.BAD REPUTATION ON THE NEWS THOUGH.MY FRIEND MANAGED TO STEEL SOME LANGERIE IN 1992, FROM THEM AND WAS NEVER ARRESTED.SOOO, I DOUBT THE SECURITY THERE.HA HA HA HA."
108,18/02/2025,"The staff were attentive and helpful, and I was able to select from a diverse range of cookery books that are hard to find in other bookstores. This also saved me the trouble of buying them online."
109,10/02/2025,"I came to the store looking to buy Shiseido foundation. I asked a store member where can I find this and she said that they do not sell it…I double checked with another lady who showed me where in store I can actually find it. Since I did not know my shade she was happy to help me find another one from Laura Mercier and was very helpful overall (unfortunately I didn’t mark down her name). After I went to Charlotte Tilbury stand to find highlighter and experience just went to zero… lady working at the stand sat me in the chair to try some products on me, got distracted with another customer and never came back! I was sitting there waiting until another staff member came over to try and help but unfortunately wasn’t very helpful as she doesn’t normally work there. I was ready to buy but needed some help with matching the right product for me and instead I just sat in the chair for about 25 minutes and eventually had to leave as it was becoming ridiculous and time consuming."
110,23/01/2025,"I placed two orders and spent a total of £1,056, but I haven’t received anything. When I contacted customer service, they told me to wait for the investigation. After the investigation, they said they confirmed the package had been delivered and that they could no longer provide any further support. In other words, they are no longer helping me. customer service reply:As per my previous email, we are unfortunately unable to assist further as the orders were delivered correctly.what should I do can get my money back?"
111,14/02/2025,"Our charming assistant Freya was extremely helpful and knowledgeable and as a result I was able to find exactly what I was looking for (in running shoes). Without her advice I would have come away with the wrong size, as happened previously."
112,10/02/2025,"My wife and I visited Harrods after being referred by our hotel in London. While shopping in the ladies’ shoes section, we went to a personal shopper’s concierge where we met a middle-aged lady. After some conversation, we realized she was Polish, and when my wife tried to communicate in Polish, the situation became awkward. The lady appeared to look down on us and refused to engage in conversation, which upset my wife and ultimately ruined our experience."
113,18/02/2025,"I had the most incredible experience at Harrods today, all thanks to Mahzuzah at the Estée Lauder counter. I initially went to the Armani counter, but there was no one available, so I approached Mahzuzah as she seemed the most approachable. From the moment I spoke to her, she was incredibly kind and patient.  Due to a long-term illness, I had forgotten how to do my makeup, and Mahzuzah went above and beyond to help me. She didn’t just recommend products - she ran around the entire store, putting together a full makeup routine for me and taking the time to teach me step by step. Her warmth and genuine care made all the difference, and she even offered for me to come in if I ever needed a chat.  I left Harrods feeling so happy and glamorous, something I haven’t felt in a long time. It wasn’t just about the makeup; it was about the kindness and support she showed me. I’ll think of her every time I do my makeup. Thank you, Mahzuzah, for your incredible customer service and for making my day so special!"
114,18/02/2025,"Mia was very nice, she kindly offered to wrap my gift for me and she did it with care."
115,14/02/2025,"Gymkhana’s Biryani at Harrods Food hall is totally misleading. It’s actually white rice toppped up with chicken curry and nothing like the proper biryani we had at Gymkhana Restaurant. The portion of Samosa Chat had just One Samosa and very small portion, definitely not value for money."
116,18/02/2025,"I was served today at Harrods, Lower Ground Floor Accessories by Kaixin.She went out of her way to help me choosing all the items that I require.She was friendly, with excellent communication skills, who made my shopping experience effortless and memorable.I would highly recommend this staff to anyone looking to shop at Harrods."

118,17/02/2025,"Lolly at Givenchy treated me wonderfully. She took the time to share her extensive knowledge and experience with me. Helping me build a make up bag that is perfect for me.

I also visited Yana at Dior and had a similarly lovely experience, again sharing a great deal of knowledge with me.. creating a bespoke skincare routine etcTom ford were also incredibly helpful. Thank you ladies."
119,17/02/2025,"I had the pleasure of being assisted by Shotiros, and I can't express enough how impressed we were with her exceptional customer service. She demonstrated extensive knowledge about the products and made both my wife and me feel truly valued as customers. Her expertise and attentiveness played a significant role in our decision to purchase a Hermès Vicepiches Bag and a Hermès Men’s Belt. Thank you for such a wonderful experience!"
120,17/02/2025,"The customer service was absolutely amazing. The waiters who serves us were phemonmenal because they made sure to check if we had any allergies before we got our food, they gave my little sister a nice teddy bear to keep, they gave us precise information about the food so we knew what exactly we were eating."
121,17/02/2025,Great experience
122,15/02/2025,"I had the absolute pleasure of being assisted by Kenza at Dior, and I cannot recommend her highly enough!

132,15/02/2025,Jeff really helped me out with choosing an aftershave for my friends 30th. He gave me loads of options and took the time to listen to my response to each one and we landed on Dandy by Pengaligons which I’m in love with !!Cant recommend an in person visit to Harrods Lakeside enough and a chat with Jeff 🙌🏼🙌🏼

134,12/02/2025,"My very first experience of H beauty was fantastic. Everyone is so kind and very helpful. I had my makeup done, it cost £60 and I got to redeem the £60 back in products. I got lots of advice on how to apply my makeup properly and the different products that work better for my skin type. I had the best time and can not wait to visit again."
135,13/02/2025,"Leanne in the metro centre (Elemis) went above and beyond and gave me the best shopping experience I’ve ever had.

140,12/02/2025,"I am yet to have a bad experience at Harrods or the Harrods Beauty stores. Everytime we have been it’s been lovely. Service, attention to details, friendliness and professionalism. It has become one of my favourite places to visit because of how welcome we are made to feel. Thank you for being so kind, inclusive, non bias and helpful. I know that some people may say it’s pricey in there, we are working class people and dont have abundance of riches but there is something for everyone if you really spend time looking and there are some great deals available. It’s a great treat to go somewhere like Harrods for that special experience. We went for my husband’s birthday and found what he wanted. We also got to win some points by spinning the wheel. The champagne bar was a nice treat at the end of our visit and they even went as far as bringing my husband out a treat to celebrate his birthday. We love visiting the Harrods Beauty stores because it’s less overwhelming. Knightsbridge is beautiful and great to go but sometimes too busy to really spend time with staff discussing products. Saying that, when we do go we are always greeted with a smile and everyone is super lovely."
141,29/01/2025,Sent me a return/dirty item ordered a nearly £1300 Canada goose Coat they didn’t even bothered to check before sending most probably it was a return or got dirty because of sitting in the warehouse the jacket had marks all over it and lint very bad experience other brands give better experience and are cheaper.

154,10/02/2025,"What an absolutely awful experience at the Parfum d Salon , Henry Jacques counter. I wanted the EDP of Dentelle Au Coeur. The gentleman in the shop said they don’t have the EDP, it is sold out , only oil available. I literally spent some time with him if they can source for me from Paris . Then out of the blue , he said I may have one , went and brought the bottle . I was really taken aback ! If you had it , why did they refuse me in the first place ? Do they judge people by appearance and serve them ? Another sales person came and when made aware of what happened, he had no answer for such an unacceptable behaviour. While he was talking to me , a third person came in , interrupted our conversation and took him away . Absolutely unacceptable behaviour . I bought a 700 plus perfume , no samples , no courtesy . I don’t have words to describe how disappointing experience was that . Needless to say , my first and last visit . Avoid HJ counter in Harrods ."
155,16/01/2025,"Harrods Optician used to be excellent when Andrea do the eye test.  And the two agent Kourtney and Serhan were there.  The two agent left.  Andrea changed position, he is in charge of checking in client and offered the Eye Testing to Anika.  Anika is not qualified for this job.  She is careless, dirty hands even after Covid, does not practice hygiene.  Nothing is clean.  All she focus on is her long nails scratching my eyes.   She is an actress faking this delicate position.   Unfortunately Andrea although he is a good guy support her and pushes customers to her.  As this is their business to sell glasses.   Anika falsify my eye test so I got new glasses.  This is Harrods optician now"
156,09/02/2025,"Within the last few weeks I wrote a glowing report for the LV department, moreover one special assistant Lucy. Yesterday my Grandson wanted some Rick Owens shoes/boots  from their tiny showroom on the 2nd floor. We entered, the very young assistant COMPLETELY ignored us while she chewed gum and chatted with a colleague. Probably 2 minutes passed and I very intently caught her eye. My grandson then asked to try on a pair, they didn’t have his size so he asked for another. These were duly brought out. She SHOULD have prepared the laces on the shoes, she did not, he didn’t like the fit and I went to hand them back. She by then was bent down giggling and showing her amused colleague some pictures. Absolutely no interest in us. What a dire lack of service. We noted, yesterday more than ever before how SO many staff were amusing themselves on their phones. I suppose because Harrods really isn’t Harrods anymore just 100’s of concessions under one roof they cannot do anything about it. Service by Helen in Celine was by contrast absolutely excellent, I suspect this is because she’s not ‘young’ and she’s been properly trained. She didn’t have the boots I wanted in my size. She offered to go to a far flung storage to get another pair. We were short of time so we connected by WhatsApp. She then messaged later, and this morning she messaged again saying she’s located the boots and I can come back in and try them on. Now that’s what I call service.  So we will buy Rick Owen’s boots in Selfridges even if I do miss out on my rewards points. I personally won’t be going in there again."

158,09/02/2025,"Visited H Beauty - Acorn Walk, Milton Keynes and the service was excellent,  fun, and insightful. Lydia was incredibly helpful and knowledgeable about Acqua di Parma. Initially, I was unsure which smell i was planning to purchase (Oud & Spice was on my radar), but Lydia introduced me to Oud & Zagara. Lydia expertly guided me through the tones of Oud & Zagara and advised how the tones complemented me. Lydia listened and took the time to understand my preferences, ensuring I found a scent that truly embodied me. Thanks to Lydia's insight, I returned to the store and purchase Oud & Zagara—a fragrance that perfectly captures my essence. Lydia’s expertise and attention to detail made this a prestige experience, and I could not have asked for better service."

166,07/02/2025,Lovely experience. Treated very well and the young lady that served us was great. Wouldn’t hesitate to go back.
167,07/02/2025,Anabelle at sweaty Betty in Harrods was such a lovely help and helped me with everything I needed 😊. Great service
168,23/01/2025,I like everything in the same place and all the brand it's easy to find it but I dislike there's no trolley or something to help us to put our shopping bags and too much crowded
169,07/02/2025,"Just about the order i placed GE7913560604GB if it says the total amount you pay includes all applicable customs duties and taxes guarantees no additional charges on delivery then it is very misleading and you do not expect to pay a bill of €36,24 if the sender has not paid the import duties and VAT DHL will pay the import duties and VAT due customs so that the package can be imported. VERY MISLEADING AND NOT NEAT i order always by spaceenk.com and beautylish.com and never have problems!!!"
170,06/02/2025,A fantastic experience at Harrods chocolate counter with good advice and guidance on choosing both gifts for other and for myself
171,06/02/2025,"I just had the best experience in Golden Goose Men's shoes, managed to get a present for my son and ship it too. Saf was incredibly helpful and Migs, the manager who put the delivery through (and all that entails:)), has been absolutely brilliant! An amazing service all around, thank you so much! Monika"
172,06/02/2025,"I just purchased my annual 2025 bear and im so happy with him, was great value for money and my bear is of such high quality, this is my first ever purchase from Harrods and i will certainly be buying from them again. I 100% recommend."
173,06/02/2025,"On 01-02-2025 i placed an order GE79135606004GB but one day before delivery i received an invoice for €36,24 which is not appropriate because it is clearly stated at checkout the total amount you pay includes all applicable customs duties and taxes quarantees no additional charges on delivery i contacted via e-mail but no response i used the whatsapp chat and the invoice and the proof of payment forwarded and than they say how good of you then you will still receive your package from trust revieuws a review was written but it is still a small effort to refund the amount the proof has been provided but so far nothing has been received wich i don t believe either i have many friends on facebook in the Netherlands and Europe and have been advised not to order from HARRODS a shame for such a million-dollar company"
174,05/02/2025,"Amazing staff and amazing products!! Lillie -  Ella, Paige and Abbie are excellent and I’m so grateful for all their help!"
175,04/02/2025,love this place and quality of food and hot chocolate is really good along with purr rose tea

177,05/02/2025,"Firing the Personal Shopping Manager - Jason, was the best thing this company has ever done!!"
178,22/01/2025,Charlotte Tilbury- OUTSTANDING Thank you Kaley my makeup was flawless and beyond my expectations - JUST PERFECT Apologies I think I misspelt the lady’s name in my initial review …🤦‍♀️
179,01/02/2025,"Dear LS01-02-2025 i placed an order GE7913560604GB but one day the package was to be delivered i received a bill for €36,24 if not the package was hold wich i find strange because at checkout says The total amount you pay includes all applicable customs duties and taxes guarantees no additional charges on delivery i have sent 4 e- mails but no response so far. Then texted the bill and the story but didn t get serious i paid the bill wich is not actually supposed to be the case. I informed my friends on facebook because they also wanted to order from HARRODS i come from the Netherlands"
180,03/02/2025,Shiva you are a wonderful person I had problems with my face and I asked her to recommend a foundation with the best coverage she didn't just stay with that she told me everything in detail how I should take care of my face and even though it was a bit expensive she had the best foundation but it was definitely worth the money my face is soft and smooth. Thank you for all your help and your cheerfulness today I hope we meet again. All the staff are wonderfully friendly and very attentive.
181,16/12/2024,I had the worst experience in Hounslow Very Posh sales person not kind at allAnd I found out Qatar owns them so they are never getting my money again
182,03/02/2025,". I have now spent more than three months dealing with these incompetent customer services team trying to spend a £500 voucher that will not process online;-	Multiple phone calls – in excess of 20 calls-	Multiple emails – in excess of 30-	Multiple promises to be called back but never once actually done.  Ten times I have been told someone will call me back and NOT ONCE has someone done this -	I have missed out on Black Friday sales,  christmas shopping in December when I tried to spend the voucher and again and New Year’s Day sales where I tried to spend the voucher-	All of this resulting in a reissued voucher – reissued  for only £149!!  And then being told the only solution is for me to spend two hours of my day physically going to the store with ID to reissue it!Unbelievable. As soon as this voucher is sorted I am selling it.  Have no interest in ever dealing with these muppets again"
183,17/01/2025,My two favorites ladies from the Hair and Beauty Salon on the 5th Floor of Harrods are Joy and Priyanka. They are just amazing!Priyanka can do magic with your eyebrows while Joy’s beautiful smile makes the checkout a joyous experience. They are so sweet and always smiling.
184,02/02/2025,"The Tudor store at Harrods has become my go-to authorized dealer for all my Tudor Watch purchases. They have an incredible selection and are able to quickly source all Tudor models, even the most sought-after timepieces while at the same time offering a first class service. I had the good fortune to deal with Hameed, who regularly kept me updated during the wait for my latest watch and acted in truly a professional manner throughout my purchase. A true first-class experience from start to finish. I look forward to purchasing more Tudor timepieces from him at the Tudor Harrods store in the near future."
185,31/01/2025,Went to Harrods after many years of not been there. The atmosphere was electric just as in the old days. As a constructive feedback the place was way too hot to enjoy shopping for long. Perhaps they could turn heating down a bit. The food hall was amazing -went to Dim Sum for a sit down meal and would definitely recommend.
186,01/02/2025,Like an adult sweet shop and I was Verruca Salt! Staff are so cute.
187,11/01/2025,"I went to the food hall with my daughter, after sitting down, i wanted to go to toilet and asked my girl sat there as she didn't wanna go. i already trained her not to talk to stranger. and by that time, no staff was available and as i dun wanna disturb the staff, i went to toilet on my own. after a day shopping in harrods, my feet were so painful that i couldn't wear shoes n walked slowly to the toilet(u know how far from food hall to the toilet in harrods bookshop!) when i came back, the secruity guard yelled at me by saying i owed my girl an apology and he said he wasn't care where i came from...WHAT?  then he accursed me overdrunk, ruined my day. Please check how much I spent in Harrods, just because I dun feel well n need to go to toilet, dun wanna bother u guys, you can treat me like a piece of shit? i have never ever been insulted like that, that's why no one want to go to harrods anymore, lesson learnt."
188,01/02/2025,Excellent service and great customer care
189,30/01/2025,"My experience was made great by the service I received.I was looked after by Jamie, he listened to what I wanted and knew his stuff…I left very knowledgeable by the product I bought and my stepson was delighted with his birthday present…Thank you Jamie… and H Beauty.."
190,01/02/2025,Afternoon tea was terrible. Dry sandwiches where they had been made and left sitting out. Duck one tasted awful. Waitress a little abrupt and needs to work on her manner when speaking to customers. Really poor experience for 6 people who paid £645 for their afternoon tea. Never again
191,10/04/2024,Shopping in harrods furniture is  an amazing experience specially when you get help and advises by an experienced excellent trustworthy and friendly sale assistant like miss Souad Almasri It makes the whole experience so amazing and not stressful at allYou feel you are in safe hands
192,01/02/2025,"Personalised advise, finding the right product for me"
193,29/01/2025,"WHOW, WHAT an amazing experience I had with all the staff, and ROSANNA was exceptional- I’m still in awe and amazement for how I was treated like royalty.. and the quality time spent explaining and showing me- was listening and I felt heard, and her patients is commendable, he warmth and her personality -a true treasure to the company… for days I’m still saying AWE with warmth in my heart for how she took the time to make each gift so beautifully and carefully packaged for me.. .. the other staff around were also very helpful- Gemma took a lot of time and patients setting me up on the system to get my £20.00 winning rewards on the computer. I received a lot of love and care and attention- just what I needed at that time.  BIG THANK YOU AND ESPECIALLY TO ROSANNA  Love Alexandria 🩵🕊🪽🥰"
194,01/02/2025,"Walked into the store at metro centre, was approached by a lovely polite young lady who helped me with all my purchases!Lauren is a great asset to Harrods Beauty"
195,01/02/2025,"If I could give a zero rating I would. Bought two items before Christmas, when they arrived they had sales stickers on, I contacted customer services to request a refund for the difference, they took almost 2 weeks to respond, asking me to return the items for a full refund. If Harrods had contacted me sooner I could have bought the items again in the sale and returned the other items. When customer services finally respond each time they ask for further information although the information is already in the email thread (delay tactics). Your staff also need more training on how to speak/respond to your customers in a polite/profession manner, take on board what your customers are telling you, and learn from this. John Lewis provides a far better customer service than Harrods. Harrods you should be ashamed on how you dealt with my refund request, it’s not about the money, it’s about doing the right thing by your customers,  needless to say I have removed the App and unsubscribed and will never use Harrods again."
196,01/02/2025,It was successful so I got what I need The employee Alba Julian
197,20/01/2025,Great service from Rolex Harrods from Samim !

199,29/01/2025,I am immensely grateful to Mr Unal Keray (from the Reflex department in Harrods) for all the time he spent with me answering all my questions and being so patient.Nothing was too much trouble to discuss and he was so patient!He went above and beyond customer service.I really look forward to receiving my table.
200,31/01/2025,"Rosie I, at the Clarins desk was so lovely and helped me without being overbearing"
201,30/01/2025,Great customer service from Matthew in sports
202,29/01/2025,"The staff were attentive, informative and patient. Gave me some excellent feedback, brought extra options that were not on display. Even went to the added effort and shared whatsapp details so I could message remotely (either in advance of a visit or even to request an item posted to my home - which is in a different country!) Excellent personable service - especially by Yusra :)"
203,30/01/2025,Dean served me today and was incredibly helpful. She spent time with me at the beauty bar trying different products. When serving she told me all about the recycling which I didn’t know about. She checked my points for me at the till. She was kind and smiling and made my visit a joy today. Thanks so much Dean :-)
204,29/01/2025,It's my second shopping experience with Milica and I was super happy with the outcome. She helped me find a wishlist bag I have been waiting for!

207,29/01/2025,Marta at pat mcgrath counter was amazing! She helped find the best present for my girlfriend with a kind and friendly face
208,29/01/2025,It is an experience definitelyI was there for the first time today... and i was born in London and lived here my whole life.It is really nice and it kinda feels like walking through a museum.But the prices are insane. I promise you if you go there and you earn a normal salary you won´t buy anything.BUT it was a nice experience overall and everyone was friendly : )
209,04/01/2025,I always enjoy my shopping experience at Hermes ground floor at harrods. I’m always satisfied with Fabiola Tecca’s service at the store.
210,26/01/2025,"Tried to return an unopened eyebrow gel the next day to H Beauty Metrocentre and was told they don't do beauty returns. Absolutely staggering when every other beauty company like Space NK, Boots and Sephora manage it. No one mentioned it on purchase and no, I didn't read the tiny small print at the till."
211,27/01/2025,Miranda was really amazing from beauty clarins section. She was so friendly and professional and explaint everything with so much love and care. Best customer service I ever recieved and she really made my day. Wow. I look forward to return.
212,25/01/2025,"Fantastic variety, all price ranges, wonderfully displayed, and staff and personnel very friendly, helpful and knowledgeable."
213,26/01/2025,Great service and excellent information provided. Staff give you great offers and advice on products and promotions.
214,26/01/2025,"Limited vegetarian choice and very limited value for what you pay. The food was good, but I would not expect to pay such a high sum for a vegetarian main dish."
215,25/01/2025,"I visited your Harrod’s Beauty store in Milton Keynes last week and felt the need to email about the service I received.This was my first time in this store, which I found to be laid out very well to browse round with lovely décor and helpful staff too.A stand out staff member who made my visit a very pleasant one, so much so i felt the need to email you to bring her to your attention.While visiting your Carolina Herrera stand I was greeted by a lovely young lady called Molly. I found Molly very easy to speak too, she was well presented and very welcoming.Molly was more than happy to talk me through the products, answer all my questions and was very knowledgeable too, not pushy or over bearing as some staff can be at times.People are very quick to make complaints when receiving bad service, and not compliment when good service is received.I would like to thank Molly for her time and not making me feel rushed. She is a credit to your store, because of this I will definitely be recommending & revisiting Harrods Beauty to shop at Carolina Herrera for the foreseeable future."
216,24/01/2025,"If you ever want to use the Harrods Personal Shopping service, stay far far far away from Kasey Bishop!! So rude and incredibly bad at his job. Awful styling and opinions. Very clear the brands in the store do not like him also.  I have never experienced customer service as bad as his, I am still in shock, he came across like he didn't know what he was doing"
217,25/01/2025,"I went into Harrods Beauty MK looking for foundation (which I haven't worn since pre-lockdown!), and was wowed by the ladies who served me!The ladies on both counters (Dior and Sisley) offered me thier significant product knowledge in addition to taking thier time and being patient whilst I asked questions on application and wear.I was incredibly impressed by the time and care they took to support me and suggestions of linking products without the pushing I associate with other stores- I cannot recommend visiting the Harrods Beauty Milton Keynes enough - truly exceptional."
218,26/01/2025,Very amazing facial experience with Lynette at Harrods Bristol.Thanks Lynette!!
219,25/01/2025,Excellent service from Sara on The Patisserie counter. I have left a private review for Sara with Harrods due to her outstanding service when a group of ladies became verbally aggressive when my ticket was called before theirs. I can’t thank Sara enough for making an uncomfortable moment pass. Purchasing from her was a joy. I will shop at The Patisserie again and hope I have the pleasure of being served by her. The cakes of course were delicious!
220,26/01/2025,Always a pleasure and nice e experience to visit harrods in Bristol the customer service is second to none and lynette on the Elimis counter is always happy to suggest different things to try
